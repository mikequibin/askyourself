Remember, what you study is just as important as where you study.

						<h1>Be the Judge</h1>
						<p><b>Come up with a list of your own criteria.</b> This can be used to evaluate and weed out the colleges in your mind. Do you want to live close to home or far away? Does it have top-of-the-line facilities? How about the teachers? Here's a list of common criteria worth pondering:
							</br>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						    <li>In-demand Degrees Offered </li>
	                        <li>Accessible Location Nationwide (rural and urban setting) </li>
							<li>Student-teacher Ratio </li>
							<li>Cost-efficient Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees </li>
							<li>Scholarship and Financial Assistance Programs </li>
							<li>State-of-the-art Campus Facilities </li>
							<li>Engaging Curriculum </li>
							<li>Strong Career Services </li>
							<li>Campus Safety </li>
							<li>Notable Internship Opportunities </li>
							<li>Student Development Activities (includes extra-curricular activities like organizations, clubs and sports, etc.)</li>
							</ul>
							</br>
						<h1>Decision is the key</h1>
						<p>Settle on what you like to study in college. <b>Knowing what you want to pursue</b> can help you find which college best offers and specializes in the field you yearn.
							</br></br>
							<h1>Strong Career Services</h1>
						<p>Most students, including you, go to college with the hope of landing in an appealing job upon graduation. So as you conduct your college search, <b>look into the school's career services.</b>
							</br>
							<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						    <li>What kind of assistance does the school offer as you apply for jobs? </li>
	                        <li>Does the college bring job fairs to campus? </li>
							<li>Does the college conduct mock interviews to help students prepare for the real thing?</li>
							</ul>
						    </br>
						<h1>Education through Experience</h1>
						<p>A college degree can give you the knowledge and skills required to succeed in your field. However, it does not promise success unless you learn to apply what you learned in the real world. So, it is imperative that you <b>choose a school that can provide you real life education and give you real life experiences</b> that will prepare you to become a globally competitive professional in the future.
							</br></br>
						<h1>Visit the Campus</h1>
						<p>Truthfully, you can't find all the answers to your questions in a college website or brochure. That is why it is important to <b>visit the campuses you’re interested in.</b> This will help you understand the school more and give you a chance to talk face-to-face with the students, administrators, and faculty members. 
							</br></br>
						   Call in advance to <b>schedule a visit and ask for a possible campus tour.</b> You can inquire too if the school has special activities for prospective students. If it does, try to partake in one. When you visit, find time to observe. Try to eat in the cafeteria and hang around in the student activity center or other highly traffic areas that will make you familiar in the environment. 
							</br></br>
						<h1>Take a look at the Facilities</h1>
						<p><b>A school’s facilities is an important factor</b> in choosing the right school. Does the school have ab environmental conducive learning? Are they equipped with laboratories that conform to industry standards? These are needed to be checked out for these will help shape your skills and competitiveness pertinent in having a successful career someday.
							</br></br>
							<h1>Go Places</h1>
						<p>Colleges do not only come in different sizes, they are also everywhere! Some are in large cities while others are in rural areas. Some are far from your home and some are near. Then if being at home on weekends is important and <b>distance is a factor, pick a school that is accessible and convenient for you.</b>
							</br></br>
						<h1>Across the Borders</h1>
						<p>A good education needs to get you thinking beyond your immediate surroundings and employers often look for applicants who are worldly. As you search for the school, <b>find out about on-the-job training programs or internships for the students.</b>
						    </br></br>
						<h1>You Can Afford to Go to College</h1>
						<p>If you think that you cannot afford college based on what you see and read in the catalog, you will probably miss the boat. It is hard to talk about money, but if you look into all the options, for sure you'll find affordable choices.
							</br></br>
						 So, <b>don't make your college choice based on the price stated in the promotional materials.</b> There are financial assistance programs available to help you out: grants, scholarships, work-study, loans, etc. Choose for your college first then let the college work with you. The Admissions Officer is the one who can determine what it will really cost you and give you options.  
							</br></br>
								<p>Whatever choice you'll make, keep in mind that education unlocks the opportunity to unravel and realize your capabilities, leads you on the path of self-discovery, and provides you with the means to achieve success in life. So don't let this chance slip away, grab it and hold it tightly. As soon as you embark on this wonderful journey, make everyday a learning experience and be the best that you can be.
