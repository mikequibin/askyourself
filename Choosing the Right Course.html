							</br>
							</br>
							For some, choosing a college course is effortless and easy. Some people know exactly what and who they want to be someday. Although for others, and maybe for you too, deciding what course to take up is probably one of the hardest decisions you will make in your life. 
							</br>
							</br>
							There came a point when making choices was plain and simple. But, choosing a college course is tricky. You have to decide between shades of gray and a plethora of courses that universities and colleges offer.
							</br>
							</br>
							So to help you out, here is a list of things that you might want to consider when choosing a college course:

						<h1>Listen to your Heart</h1>
						<p>Cheesy as it may sound but choosing a college course should really depend on what your heart tells you. </br><b>It must be a choice straight from the heart -a course you believe you would succeed in.</b> Though it is not bad to consider what your parents, relatives, and friends are telling you, but always think that at the end of the day, <b>it is you who will devote time and commitment in studying.</b> Just like any relationships, it will be difficult to be at your best when you do not wholeheartedly love what you are doing. As a result, you might end up dropping out, shifting to another course, or worst, become disinterested in pursuing a college education.
							</br></br>
						<h1>Your Interest Counts</h1>
						<p><b>The more interested you are in a subject, the more likely that you will give attention and focus to it.</b> For example, if you are into travelling, cooking or baking, then a Hospitality and Tourism Management-related course could be your option. If that's the case, then it will give you a head start and you will be able to fulfill its requirements no matter how difficult it will be because you enjoy what you do. Seek professional help also by taking time talking to your school's guidance counselor who can provide you different interest tests and give you pieces of advice.
							</br></br>
							<h1>Consider your Aptitudes</h1>
						<p>In choosing a course, it's also worth <b>considering your skills and talents.</b> You may know what you want, but do you know what you're good at? Interest and aptitude are two different things. Interest refers to your hobbies or something you love doing, while aptitude is your natural ability which includes verbal, numerical or analytical reasoning. Ideally, you should pursue a college course that allows you to explore both. <b>Pick a course you will be good at and aligned with your interest.</b>
							</br></br>
							<h1>Dig, Explore and Investigate</h1>
						<p>Nowadays, there are colleges offering the same courses, so it is important to <b>give yourself time to review and explore the school you are interested in.</b> It is essential that you read the prospectus, course brochures, and websites to find the course program that best suits your requirements.
							</br></br>
                            <h1>What's In & Out?</h1>
						<p>There are instances when certain courses may appear to be more popular than others due to current circumstances. But this should not be your primary reason in choosing your course. Instead, <b>go after the course which you really like and count the wide array of career opportunities it has in store for you someday.</b>
							</br></br>
                            <h1>Keep your Faith</h1>
						<p>After deciding the course you want to explore, <b>hold on to that faith and believe that you will succeed.</b> After all, He knows what path you will ultimately tread.
							</br></br>
								<p>Choosing a course will take some time. It could take several weeks or even months of contemplation and research. But whatever course you may decide to take, it is important that you give your 100%.
